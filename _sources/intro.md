# ECE 281: Digital Design and Computer Architecture

```{tableofcontents}
```

## Course Goals

The goal of this course is for all cadets enrolled in the course to develop the ability to understand and design combinational and sequential circuits and construct, test, and debug these circuits using schematic diagrams and hardware description languages.  Cadets shall demonstrate an understanding of basic computer architecture and how a computer executes simple programs.

## Course Objectives

Cadets shall be able to:

- Demonstrate ability to design, analyze, and implement combinational and sequential circuits using schematic diagrams.
- Demonstrate ability to design, analyze, and implement combinational and sequential circuits using a hardware description language.
- Use contemporary software tools to debug a digital system design and verify that a digital system meets defined requirements.
- Demonstrate the ability to understand and analyze a microarchitecture (datapath and control unit) to implement a simple computer architecture.
- Demonstrate the ability to properly record and report laboratory work.
